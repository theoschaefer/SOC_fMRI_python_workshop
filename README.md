### Welcome

In this repository, you can find the material and data for the School Of Cognition workshop 2022 on functional MRI preprocessing.  
The workshop is based on a [2021 tutorial](https://gitlab-ce.gwdg.de/frauke.beyer/soc_coding_tutorials) by [Frauke Beyer](https://gitlab-ce.gwdg.de/frauke.beyer) and was updated by [Alexander Nitsch](https://github.com/nitschalex) and [Theo SchÃ¤fer](https://github.com/theoschaefer).
